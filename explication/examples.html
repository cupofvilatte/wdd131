                <h2>Explication</h2>
                <h3 class="example-term">State</h3>
                <p class="state-term">Explication is the process of systematically clarifying our ideas while, at the same time, exploring their meaning.</p>
                <h3>Elaborate</h3>
                <p class="elaborate-term">In other words, when we explicate an idea, we make several intellectual moves that each comes at the idea in a different way, each making the idea clearer while at the same time casting new light on the idea. Those moves include stating, elaborating, exemplifying, and illustrating.</p>
                <h3>Exemplify</h3>
                <p class="exemplify-term">For example, we might explicate a complex idea like faith, or a difficult text like a poem or the Declaration of Independence, in order to clarify it and to explore its meaning. I'm explicating the idea of explication right now as an example of the process of explication.</p>
                <h3>Illustrate</h3>
                <p class="illustrate-term">The process of explication is like putting a complex object under several kinds of light at different angles to reveal its nature. Just as Monet painted the façade of Rouen Cathedral in all kinds of light — bright morning, cloudy afternoon, evening — to reveal the full spectrum of possible visual experiences one might have of the cathedral, so also we might explicate an idea, a poem, a novel, or a passage of scripture, using the different moves to cast new light on the concept.</p>
                <h3>Compare or Contrast</h3>
                <p class="compare-term"> Explication, like explanation, clarifies ideas. However, unlike simple explanation, explication explores the complexity of an idea in a careful, systematic way. This distinction is suggested in the etymology of the two words. Explain derives from the Latin ex-, which functions both as a prepositional or adverbial prefix 'out' or 'un-' and as an intensifier, and the stem planus, 'flat, level, plain, clear'. The word explain, then, suggests the image of laying something out flat, as one lays out a map, so as to see it more clearly. The word explicate, on the other hand, derives from the Latin plicare, 'to fold, plait, or weave'. To explicate is to carefully unfold, unweave or untwist something that is braided or woven in a complex way.</p>
                <h3>Divide or Make a Distinction</h3>
                <p class="divide-term">There is only one kind of explication; however, explication itself involves at least seven different intellectual moves, listed above. One could say that there are at least seven ways to explicate an idea, although a thorough and systematic explication will involve several of these.</p>
                <h3>Apply</h3>
                <p class="apply-term">Explication is a powerful tool for learning. Suppose that you are studying photosynthesis in your biology class. Try explicating the ideas involved. If you can't, then go back and review until you can. When you can explicate a concept clearly, accurately, and thoroughly, then you understand that concept, and trying to explicate these ideas is the best way to come to understand them. That's much better than just memorizing a definition. Explication is also a powerful tool for teaching. Suppose that you are teaching a gospel doctrine class on Paul's letter to the Hebrews, and you need to lead a discussion of Hebrews 11:1. Instead of just asking for random insights, you could focus the discussion by asking someone to state what it means for faith to be “the substance [or foundation] of things hoped for.” Then ask someone to elaborate on that statement. Then ask for an example, then a metaphor or analogy. Then ask how faith, as the substance of our hopes, is different from mere belief. And maybe make a distinction among the kinds of things we hope for and how faith, then, might be a different kind of foundation depending upon the object of our hopes. Finally, you might ask what it would be like to live and act on faith in this sense. Teaching in this way will transform both your own and your students' understanding.</p>
